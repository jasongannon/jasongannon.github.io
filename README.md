## Summary

During my career as a technical writer, I’ve developed skills for communicating complex information in clear ways. I have well-developed technical skills, and I place an emphasis on team building, problem solving, and open communication.

My role is to learn systems and work with clients and developer teams to identify user requirement, craft specifications, and analyze user workflows. I am flexible and hard-working; eager to support colleagues and assist stakeholders to define requirements.

I am proficient with computers and a range of software, including a very strong knowledge of desktop and web publishing. I am analytical in my approach to the work, relying on proven methods and open communication to steer the project towards success.
