## Summary

During my career as a technical writer, I’ve developed skills for communicating complex information in clear ways. I am an English major with a strong understanding of language—style, usage, and grammar. I have well-developed software skills, and I place an emphasis on team building and problem solving. I enjoy engaging with projects early and mapping out the relevant information.

My role is to learn systems and work with clients and developer teams to identify user requirement, craft specifications, and analyze user workflows. I am flexible and hard-working; eager to support colleagues and take ownership of projects. I enjoy learning new things and am currently improving my understanding of backend development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity needs.

Research and planning are important to me; I prefer rigourous, well-defined processes. I am a strong editor and work with stakeholders to continually improve documentation. To avoid wordy text, I try to delete what is unnecessary, providing only essential or useful information. I adhere to relevant style guides and incorporate images and video to make information more engaging.

I am proficient with computers and a range of software, including a very strong knowledge of desktop and web publishing. I am analytical in my approach to the work, relying on proven methods and open communication to steer the project towards success.
